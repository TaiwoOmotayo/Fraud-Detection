 Fastag Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Fastag Fraud Detection project repository. This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions within the Fastag electronic toll collection system. I leverage machine learning techniques to enhance fraud detection capabilities and ensure the integrity of transactional data.

## Project Files
- **FastagFraudDetection.csv**: Dataset containing transactional records relevant to Fastag operations.
- **Fraud Detection Mentorness.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook detailing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation procedures.
- **Fraud_prediction.sav**: Serialized model file containing a trained machine learning model for fraud prediction.
- **Problem statement- Fastag Fraud detection.pdf**: Document outlining the project's objectives, methodologies, and findings related to Fastag fraud detection.
- **README.md**: Comprehensive guide providing project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Directory for storing additional datasets used during the project lifecycle.
- **notebooks/**: Folder containing Jupyter notebooks for detailed data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- **models/**: Repository for storing serialized models and related artifacts post-training.
- **scripts/**: Collection of scripts used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model deployment tasks.

## Setup Instructions
To replicate and extend this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Ensure Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook are installed to execute the project notebooks.
4. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open `Fraud Detection Mentorness.ipynb` for a detailed walkthrough of data analysis, preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage
- Utilize the provided Jupyter notebook to gain insights into data preprocessing techniques, model selection, and performance evaluation metrics.
- Adapt and extend the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to suit specific data preprocessing requirements or model deployment scenarios.
